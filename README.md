👋 Hi, I'm T|O|M|E|K 👀 I'm deeply invested in the worlds of SQL, MySQL and SQLite, working on data maintenance and analytics in the logistics industry.
🌱 I'm currently refining my skills in PHP, while exploring the Nette Framework and Bootstrap 5.
🛠️ I use Visual Studio (augmented with GitHub Copilot) and dBeaver daily to keep up with the demands of my role.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the ČFK website project, an initiative close to my heart.
