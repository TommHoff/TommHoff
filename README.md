👋 Hark! 

I am now over 40 summers young, a lad still oft with radical musings, born in 🇨🇿, a fervent admirer of Polska, heart in 🇵🇱 (especially the High Tatras!), and a devout Catholic with faith in 🇻🇦, randomly attending Sunday mass with steadfast devotion; adrift 'twixt labors for Sumisho Global Logistics, the noble Japanese art martial under the banner of the Czech Kendo Federation, and Nippon's verdant brews and the darkest of chocolates.
